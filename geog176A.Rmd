In the summer of 2020 I took a class GIS course based in R. I worte some code, and did some cool data science. Here is a collection of links! 

## [Lab 01: Building a project website](https://github.com/ZhongchangYao/ZhongchangYao.git)

- I build a static users site with Github Pages for the first time.
- Learning to combine texts with supplements, such as links and graphs.
- Choosing personal settings of this website.


## [Lab 02: Data Wrangling](https://zhongchangyao.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-02.html)

- reading in data using readr
- manipulating data and tables
- ggplot to show the result

## [Lab 3: Projections, Distances, and Mapping](https://zhongchangyao.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-03.html)

- use sf to manipulate data for further edition
- showing the targeted result with gghighlight
- filter the targeted data to analyze the boundry

## [Lab 4: Tesselations, Spatial Joins, and Point-in-Polygon](https://zhongchangyao.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-04.html)

- make different centroids for different tessellations
- using tessellations to represent different forms
- using the making functions

## [Lab 05: Rasters analysis and Remote Sensing](https://zhongchangyao.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-05.html)

- combinning the raster data
- showing different forms with various colors
- analyzing kmeans

## [Lab 06: Terrain Analysis](https://zhongchangyao.github.io/geog-176A-labs/lab-06.html)

- open street tools
- using the whitebox tool to draw image
- analyze the real situation of flood
- generating the realistic map
